1. `my_collection[key]` is supported by `my_collection.__getitem__(key)`

## Basic language constructs
1. iteration
2. collections
3. attribute access
4. operator overloading
5. function and method invocation
6. object creation and destruction
7. string representation and formatting
8. managed contexts (i.e. with blocks)


2. Since Python 2.6 `namedtuple` can be used to build classes of objects that are just 
bundles of attributes with no custom methods, like a database record.

```shell

>>> beer_card = Card("7", "diamonds")
>>> beer_card
Card(rank="7", suit="diamonds")
```
